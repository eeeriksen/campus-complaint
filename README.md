# FISK + TSU GOOGLE IN RESIDENCE HBCU HACKATHON 2023

## Fisk & TSU Hackathon Problem Statement

As students, you’re receiving an education and you’re interacting with other students and faculty (professors and university administration). For this hackathon, make an app to help would benefit students, teachers, or schools.

## Our solution
- Students and faculty alike face problems on campus
- Sometimes solving these problems would only take minutes if word gets to the right person, or if they could just get some words of advice from someone who went through the same thing before
- Figuring out what administrator to send an email to and composing that email is a barrier that may be keeping many students from even trying to get help
- Without transparency, it is unclear if that email is ever even read or if it just sits in an inbox full of similar complaints that are being ignored
- **CampusComplaints** aims to make it easier for students to share the problems they are facing, organize their opinions in one place to make it clear what issues are most pressing to the student body, and ultimately bring the problem to the attention of those who can do something about it
